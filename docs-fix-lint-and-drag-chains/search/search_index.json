They do this by driving 2 brass TR8x8 lead-screw nuts towards each other to engage both sides of the lead-screw threads.</p> <p>In order for this to work the preload required to drive each nut needs to be tuned by hand. To tune the preload make sure the lead-screws are greased appropriately, then install the 2 brass TR8x8 lead-screw nuts within the anti backlash block.</p> <p>Tighten the screws on one of the nuts so that it does not move, while leaving the other nut loose.</p> <p>Install the greased lead-screw temporarily into the block and begin to tighten the loose nut, taking care to apply the same number of turns to each of the screws.</p> <p>The ideal preload will allow for the lead-screw to still spin by hand but should have a moderate amount of resistance to it. Once complete make sure each bolt has threadlock applied, and uninstall the lead-screw - your preload is now set.

These parts will need to be drilled and or cut out before use.</p> <p>Layer Height and Line Width</p> <p>Some parts have sacrificial floors to allow unsupported features to be printed successfully. These floors are designed to work at a layer height of 0.2mm, so they may not be sliced correctly if your layer height is not 0.2mm.</p> <p>There are also some parts containing overhangs that will become more difficult to print with thicker layers due to the overhang angle.</p> <p>Unless you're willing to experiment and almost certainly waste filament, stick with 0.2mm layers.</p> <p>We provide a Minimum Wall Thickness for every printable part, which is the minimum total thickness of your perimeter lines and top and bottom solid layers. This depends on the size of your nozzle and line width settings in your slicer so must be calculated.</p> <p>Given a 0.4mm nozzle, 100% perimeter line width, 0.2mm layers and a minimum wall thickness of 2.4mm, you would set your slicer to generate a minimum of 6 perimeters and 12 top / bottom layers.</p>"},{"location":"milo/printing/print_guide/#x-axis-assembly","title":"X-Axis Assembly","text":"Name Infill Min.
